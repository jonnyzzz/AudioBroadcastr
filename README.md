Audio broadcasting app to capture what-u-head audio and 
to send it to a Pioneer *921 as audio stream

Work is in progress. Current state supports only capture (that to NAudio),
conversion to MP3 and micro-http server that serves the MP3 at `http://<host>:9765/mp3`

Next is to make this capable to UPNP, so home recivers could play the stream
